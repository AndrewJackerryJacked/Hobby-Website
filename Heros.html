  <p>Heroes are playable characters in Overwatch. There are currently 25 playable heroes in the game, categorized into 4 roles: Offense, Defense, Tank, and Support. The heroes of Overwatch each bring their own unique powers and game-changing ultimate abilities into battle. 
  Along with their own roles on the battlefield, their potential is amplified when they assemble into a formidable team. Player's options for achieving victory are endless when a team of heroes can defy gravity, transform into rapid-firing turrets, or conjure billboard-sized energy shields.</p>

<h1> Offense </h1>
<p>Offense heroes possess high mobility and are usually great damage dealers. They are good at scouting, harassment, and pressing objectives. 
Movement abilities are often associated with offense heroes.</p>

<h1> Mcree </h1>
<h2> Role: Flanker/Duelist</h2>
<img src="Mcree.png">
<p>Gunslinger and vigilante, McCree makes use of his revolver to slay his foes, flashbangs to stun, and has a combat roll to avoid danger.
As befits a gunslinger, McCree is the game's best duelist. He is capable of killing almost anyone he gets up close to with blinding speed by stunning them with Flashbang and unloading his Peacekeeper into them.
The accurate hitscan nature of his primary weapon also makes him suitable for fighting mobile targets like Genji and Pharah at medium range.
His damage falls off a cliff at longer ranges, and his low mobility means that he has to take conventional routes to get up close to his opponents, making it easy to outflank him and kill him before he has a chance to fire back. 
His Ultimate Deadeye causes him to move incredibly slow and charges up damage on any targets he can see on the screen McCree takes a few precious moments to aim; when he’s ready to fire, he shoots every enemy in his line of sight. The weaker his targets are, the faster he’ll line up a killshot. </p> 


<h1> Genji </h1>
<h2> Role: Flanker</h2>
<img src="Genji.png">
<p>Genji flings precise and deadly Shuriken at his targets, and uses his wakizashi to deflect projectiles or delivers a Swift Strike with his technologically-advanced katana that cuts down enemies.
His ultimate, Dragonstrike, has the potential to be the most powerful ultimate in the game. Genji brandishes his katana for a brief period of time. Until he sheathes his katana, Genji can deliver killing strikes to any targets within his reach.
Genji is a versatile flanker with very high mobility, boasting some of the best movement options of all the heroes. Genji is better suited for close quarters to make use of his mobility and spread shurikens, but can still be formidable at range.
 His passive ability,Cyber-Agility allows him climb up walls. This makes Genji a difficult target and allows him to navigate the map with ease. Swift Strike allows Genji to engage, escape or move between targets efficiently. The damage on Swift Strike is considerable for most heroes, but is insignificant to a tank.
As such, Genji should use Swift Strike to either maneuver around his enemies or deal small but quick and easy damage. Reflect allows Genji to turn enemies' damage back towards them and even allows him to turn around entire ultimate abilities. This allows for potentially lethal burst damage if it is timed properly and Genji is well positioned. 
Be wary when estimating your own abilities as Genji however, you are not the most agile hero nor do you deal the most damage. Genji fills a middle ground when it comes to these factors.</p>


<h1> Pharah </h1>
<h2> Role: Moblie/Flanker </h2>
<img src="Pharah.png">
<p>Pharah is a versatile and mobile Offense hero, capable of limited-duration flight. This gives her good escape capabilities, excellent vantage in open-air situations, and enables her to reach enemy snipers with ease. Her Ultimate ability Barrage allows her to rain heavy damage down on her enemies.Pharah is a hero who possess the skill of aerial-control.
 Her Rocket Launcher fires a rocket in linear line. The rocket deals heavy damage upon impact and some splash damage nearby which can disrupt the enemy's position. Hover allows her to move upward, making her gain some amount of vertical height. Pharah can use Jump Jet in conjunction with Hover to quickly boost her height to mid-air. 
 Concussive Blast deals no damage, but create a strong knockback that can push both Pharah and the enemy within the blast. Her ultimate ,Barrage, is the most devastating, be able to wipe out all targets within second. However, the rocket is very slow, unable to deal full effect when it can't hit the enemy. Hover stills has a fuel limit, making her fall to ground quickly if she can't combine usage with Jump Jet. 
 Although Pharah can dodge attacks with Hover, she is naturally slow by default, unlike other offense heroes. Her strong aerial capability is well-countered by the heroes who possess hitscan-type weapon, since it's attack has no travel time and be able to hit Pharah with ease. </p>
 
 
 <h1> Tracer </h1>
 <h2> Role: Flanker </h2>
 <img src="Tracer.png">
 <p>With a unique ability to control the speed of her own passage through time, Tracer zips and blinks around the battlefield, eluding attackers and sneaking past defenses. A perfect skirmisher hero, Tracer is fragile but hard to hit, keeping one step ahead of her attackers while she harasses and harries the enemy team. 
 Tracer excels at getting behind enemy lines, but it is inadvisable to move her through chokepoints. Should she find herself blinking into an ambush, she can rewind time to her position and state a few seconds earlier, giving her a second chance. Tracer is a close-range skirmishing hero who specializes in speed and single target damage. 
 Her mobility and high single target damage makes her excellent at picking key targets with very low risk. Tracer can quickly traverse a map with the use of Blink to outflank her enemies, deal damage to them, and then retreat before they have a chance to respond. Her low base Health and lack of regenerating shields means that she must make good use of Blink and Recall to avoid or reverse damage. </p>
 
 
 <h1> Reaper </h1>
 <h2> Role: Flanker </h2>
 <img src="Reaper.png">
  <p>Reaper is a deadly assassin that can move like a ghost through the battlefield, dispatching enemies and draining the life from their corpses, disappearing before their allies can catch him. Reaper is most effective at close quarters, and uses his movement abilities to get close to vulnerable targets. He is at his best when ambushing and swiftly silencing targets before slipping back into the shadows.
  With his ultimate, Death Blossom, turning him into a deadly whirlwind, can make Reaper devastating in confined spaces, turning an enemy charge into a massacre. Reaper is a short-ranged flanker and one of the deadliest heroes in the game up close, with even Tanks like Reinhardt and Roadhog melting under the power of his Hellfire Shotguns. 
  Reaper's relative simplicity makes him a good hero for new players, while still remaining deadly in experienced hands. Despite his power, he's not without his weaknesses, with his lack of in-combat mobility and medium or long-range damage options being the most noticeable. </p>
 
 
 <h1> Sombra </h1>
 <h2> Role: Support/Disruptor/Mobile </h2>
 <img src="Sombra.png">
 <p id="rcorners1">Stealth and debilitating attacks make Sombra a powerful infiltrator. Her hacking can disrupt her enemies, ensuring they're easier to take out, while her EMP provides the upper hand against multiple foes at once. Sombra’s ability to Translocate and camouflage herself makes her a hard target to pin down. 
 Even though she can deal high damage by her own, her weapon's weakness is the large spreading which will force her to fight rather close range.  She lacks any alternative way to damage enemies or to improve in-combat mobility, allowing a hacked enemy to still fight back like normal, 
 albeit without relying on abilities, as hacking an enemy will temporarily disable their abilities. </p>
 
 
 <h1> Solider:76 </h1>
 <h2> Role: High Damage </h2>
 <img src="Soldier 76.png">
 <p id="rcorners1">The archetypal soldier hero, Soldier: 76 is intended to be a gateway hero for players more rooted in Call of Duty-styled gameplay.Soldier: 76 is the most well-rounded of the Offense heroes. He's able to deal both sustained and burst damage at any range, move quickly across the battlefield, and support both himself and his team through the use of Biotic Field. 
 The biotic field is a large area that Soldier can lay down which will heal all allies inside the field. His downsides are a lack of any real specialization with his weapons or abilities, no vertical movement, and a less impactful Ultimate when compared to other Assault heroes. 
 His ultimate, Tactical Visor, will auto target all of the enemies on the screen. But unlike Mcree's Deadeye ultimate, you will start dealing damage immediately. He's a simple hero to learn to play, but a difficult one to master, making him a great pick for new players and veterans alike.</p>
 
 
 <h1> Doomfist </h1>
 <h2> Role: Disruptor/Mobile </h2>
 <img src="Doomfist.png">
 <p>Doomfist’s cybernetics make him a highly-mobile, powerful frontline fighter. In addition to dealing ranged damage with his Hand Cannon, Doomfist can slam the ground, knock enemies into the air and off balance, or charge into the fray with his Rocket Punch. When facing a tightly packed group, Doomfist leaps out of view, then crashes down to earth with a spectacular Meteor Strike which is his ultimate.
 Doomfist will also gain temporary shields when dealing damage with his abilities. This encourages Doomfist to try and stay in the fight as long as he can. His downsides though being that he's very weak without his abilities and has the largest hitboxes out of all of the offense cast.</p>
 
<h1>Defense</h1>
<p> Defense heroes are good at guarding locations, creating choke points, and preventing objectives from being taken. 
They are skilled at area denial and generally form the back line of their team. </p>


<h1>Bastion</h1>
<h2> Role: High Damage/Stationary </h2>
<img src="Bastion.png">
<p> Repair protocols and the ability to transform between stationary Assault, mobile Recon and devastating Tank configurations provide Bastion with a high probability of victory. astion is a hero with two main forms. Its default form is a mobile bipedal form with a sub-machine gun, while the second being a completely immobile turret form. Both of these perform in unique ways, and must be utilized to their fullest. 
The most notable part of Bastion's kit is Reconfigure, which turns it into a stationary turret gun. This turret has some of the highest damage output in the game, being able to shred through shields and heroes alike, but it can't deal a critical shot. In tank form, while losing some damage output, it gets more crowd control ability, as the explosion of the shells fired are very large and dangerous to all enemies. 
However, Configuration: Sentry poses two major weaknesses to Bastion. The first is immobility, which causes Bastion to become an easy target to focus fire on. The second is a weak point that appears on its back in turret configuration. Faster heroes can easily get behind Bastion and kill it quickly with this weak point. Even though it has reasonable health and is able to repair itself in any situation, the healing ability has limits and its large frame makes it an easy target. 
Bastion is also relatively slow, making it easy to be outflanked by enemies. </p>


<h1>Hanzo</h1>
<h2> Role: Sniper </h2>
<img src="Hanzo.png">
<p>A lethal bowman and assassin without peer, Hanzo’s versatile arrows can reveal his enemies or fragment to strike multiple targets. He can scale walls to fire his bow from on high. Hanzo is a medium-range sniper with strong team utility and area denial abilities. The relatively silent and hard-to-see nature of his arrows makes him a stealthier sniper than Widowmaker, able to get kills and then retreat before his enemies see him.
Hanzo scatter arrow is also incredibly deadly to fight against. After the Scatter Arrow impacts a solid surface, it fragments into multiple arrows that ricochet several times off of solid surfaces and deal a flat amount of damage to enemies that they impact. If the initial Scatter Arrow hits an enemy, it will not fragment. The notorious power of Scatter Arrow makes him a deadly threat in tight corridors, allowing him to deny whole groups passage through an area and take out Tanks with well-placed shots. 
His downsides include relatively low in-combat mobility and the poor aim of Storm Bow at long range, often requiring him to get dangerously close to his opponents to accurately hit them. His ultimate, Dragonstrike is a freak of nature to be reckoned with When activated, Hanzo will, after a short cast time, fire a special arrow that creates a pair of spiraling twin dragons that will fly straight forwards in the direction of his crosshairs. 
These dragons will pass through all solid surfaces or barriers, dealing damage over time to any enemies that come in contact with them. The closer an enemy is to the center of the twin dragons, the more damage they will take.</p>


<h1>Junkrat (aka my favorite hero in the game!) </h1>
<h2> Role: High Damage/ Area Denial </h2>
<img src="Junkrat.png">
<p> An explosives obsessed freak, Junkrat uses his Frag Launcher to bounce grenades at his enemies while planting Concussion Mines and Steel Traps to defend targets. Junkrat is a hero that excels at defending an area through the use of traps and indirect fire; he is valued for his damage output and area denial capabilities. He has strong mobility thanks to Concussion Mine and deals high (if inaccurate) damage with his Frag Launcher. The explosive and hard-to-aim nature of his weapon, however, makes it challenging for him to fight at close range with most heroes.<p>


<h1>Mei</h1>
<h2>Role: Point Control</h2>
<img src="Mei.png">
<p> Mei’s weather-altering devices slow opponents and protect locations. Her Endothermic Blaster unleashes damaging icicles and frost streams, and she can Cryo-Freeze herself to guard against counterattacks, or obstruct the opposing team's movements with an Ice Wall.Mei is a strong fighter who excels in 1-on-1 fights. Her freezing effect from Endothermic Blaster will let her win over most heroes. Icicle deals heavy damage when used correctly, making her a threat at both short and long ranges. Ice Wall can be used to trap or distract the enemy, as it can completely block the enemy's vision, or split some of the enemies from the others. 
Mei's Cyro-Freeze creates thick ice around herself, restoring her health and rendering her invulnerable, allowing her to play like semi-tank. Blizzard is a very strong Ultimate, able to turn the tide of battle when used correctly. Not being a true tank, Mei can still be outdamaged and killed easily. Her primary fire deals little damage and needs to land several hits to fully freeze the target. Meanwhile, the Icicle has a quick damage falloff even though it is a projectile, making her less effective at long range. Due to lacking of killing power and mobility, playing her well is challenging.</p>

<h1>Torbjörn</h1>
<h2>Role: Point Control</h2>
<img src="Torbjorn.png">
<p id="rcorners1"> One of the world's greatest engineers, Torbjörn can swiftly construct and upgrade turrets, producing powerful units capable of defending areas against attackers.orbjörn is most commonly used on Defense because of his ability to cover choke-points so effectively. One option on Attack is to deploy your turrets on top of a payload, effectively creating a mobile turret.
While many players focus on Torbjörn's turret, it should be noted that Torbjörn himself deals a considerable amount of damage - his shotgun alt-fire does massive damage at close range, and his ordinary fire has solid range and does a not-inconsiderable amount of damage, especially with a headshot. It is important to make full use of both Torbjörn himself as well as his turret; focusing too much on using your turret will result in a lesser contribution to the team.When using Molten Core, the tank stats and the attack speed make you a formidable opponent, capable of easily killing low-health heroes and posing danger even towards Tanks. 
Therefore, when using the ultimate, don't be afraid to go to the front lines and start shooting. Ideally, you should try to use it when both you and your turret are engaged in combat. However, don't be afraid to ult just to upgrade your turret when you are not around or when you need the survivability and attack speed. Be wary that there is a slight delay when you use Molten Core before the turret upgrades. In a pinch, the ultimate can also be used to quickly upgrade a turret to level 2 and subsequently 3, though this is less than ideal.</p>


<h1>Widowmaker</h1>
<h2>Role: Sniper</h2>
<img src="Widowmaker.png">
<p>A cold-blooded assassin, Widowmaker is the archetypal sniper, grappling up to vantage points and lining up the perfect kill shot. Her sniper rifle and sticky mines make her a strong Defense hero, staking out choke-points and picking off any target that stands still for too long. Widowmaker is the archetypical sniper of Overwatch. Equipped with a powerful scoped rifle, she is capable of taking down the majority of the game's heroes with a single fully-charged headshot, and is still able to deal serious damage with bodyshots. 
Her Infra-Sight and Venom Mine give her and her team considerable information on enemy movements, allowing them to easily counter ambushes and coordinated pushes. She is, however, relatively weak in close-range combat, and her immobility while scoped makes her an easy target; Widowmaker's biggest threat is often another, better Widowmaker on the enemy team. </p>


<h1>Tanks</h1>
<p>Tank heroes have high endurance and excel at protecting allies and disrupting enemies. The primary role of the tank is to absorb incoming enemy fire through active abilities and a generally high health pool. Secondary to this, soaking the right amount of sustainable damage can help team supports farm ultimate charge before an engage. </p>

<h1>Reinhardt</h1>
<h2>Role: Point Control</h2>
<img src="Reinhardt.png">
<p>Reinhardt is a powerful Tank. His iconic ability Barrier Field allows him to shield allies and defend objectives, while his melee Rocket Hammer makes him a threat at close range. Charge allows him to charge and pin enemies, further enabling him to push and harass the front line. Reinhardt is the sturdiest of the Tanks, boasting high base Health and a massive barrier that allows him to protect his team from harm. While largely defense-oriented, Reinhardt can be a deadly offensive threat as well thanks to the high damage of his Rocket Hammer and ability to crush enemies against a wall with Charge. 
His ultimate, EarthShatter , will have him slam his hammer down and stun all most enemies infront of him, which can sometimes setup whole team wipes. The price he pays for all of this is that he is almost solely restricted to fighting at short range, having only a single, infrequent ranged attack.</p>


<h1> D.Va </h1>
<h2>Role: Disrupter</h2>
<img src="DVa.png">
<p>D.Va’s mech is nimble and powerful — its twin Fusion Cannons blast away with autofire at short range, and she can use its Boosters to barrel over enemies and obstacles, or deflect attacks with her projectile-dismantling Defense Matrix. D.Va is a unique tank with some mobility. With very high health and Boosters, she can close a gap to the enemy with ease. She has high damage output at close-range, making her a strong fighter in 1-on-1 match. Her Defense Matrix is useful against all incoming-projectiles, protecting her teammates from enemy fire. She is a dangerous ganker in tank class, dealing consistent damage to the enemy. 
Self-Destruct will wipe all opponents within the blast area. However, she doesn't have an extended barrier to properly protect her team like Reinhardt. She is also slow while firing, allowing the enemy to outrun her to disengage or move around her to distract her aiming. Fusion Cannons are ineffective at anything further than medium-range, makes her being outranged by the enemy before she even has a chance to close a gap with Boosters. </p>


<h1> Roadhog (Aka my second favorite hero in the game!)</h1>
<h2>Role: High Damage,Enforcer </h2>
<img src="Roadhog.png">
<p> Roadhog uses his signature Chain Hook to pull his enemies close before shredding them with blasts from his Scrap Gun. He’s hardy enough to withstand tremendous damage, and can recover his health with a short breather ability. Roadhog has a unique Tank playstyle that's focused on singling out vulnerable enemies and yanking them in for the slaughter with his Chain Hook. His Scrap Gun gives him powerful short to medium-range damage, while Take A Breather allows him to remain a persistent threat, even without a friendly Support. When Roadhog's ultimate is activated(Whole Hog),he begins to fire a broad cone of pellets in front of himself for a few seconds, dealing damage to enemies and knocking them back. 
Roadhog can still move while using Whole Hog, but he cannot use his normal weapons or abilities. This Ultimate is channeled, and can be interrupted by stuns. However, his lack of any kind of barrier makes him a lackluster pick when your focus is on protecting your teammates. He functions best as a flanker, where his chain can catch enemies unawares and kill them before they can react. With his large heal on a medium cooldown, he can operate for long periods of time away from his team. </p>


<h1> Zarya </h1>
<h2> Role: Point Control </h2>
<img src="Zarya.png">
<p>Aleksandra "Zarya" Zaryanova is a Russian, pink-haired soldier who loves to play around with particles and gravity. Her primary weapon of choice is a particle cannon which can shoot beams and balls of energy, and create shields for herself and her allies. A powerful Tank, Zarya can turn the damage she absorbs into energy to fuel her weapons, dishing out damage as she defends her team.Zarya is a challenging Tank to play, though one of the most rewarding when played well. 
She gains Energy by absorbing damage with her barrier abilities, increasing her own damage substantially. At maximum Energy, she is a monstrous threat to the enemy team, tearing them apart in seconds with her Particle Cannon. Her Ultimate has some of the highest playmaking potential in the game, with the ability to trap entire teams in a single spot for her allies to fire upon. All of this comes with a severe weakness: she is the softest of the Tanks, with the lowest base Health out of them (save for Orisa), and only an infrequent, short-duration barrier to protect her and her team.</p>


<h1> Orisa </h1>
<h2> Role: Stationary/Point Control</h2>
<img src="Orisa.png">
<p>Orisa serves as the central anchor of her team, and defends her teammates from the frontline with a protective barrier. She can attack from long range, fortify her own defenses, launch graviton charges to slow and move enemies, and deploy a Supercharger as her ultimate to boost the damage output of multiple allies at once.Orisa is an anchor tank, meaning her team will get more benefit when grouping and coordinating around her. Fusion Driver's cannon shell is a projectile; on one hand it has travel time, but on the other hand it has no damage falloff. This makes it useful against enemies at long range, provided the player can properly lead the shots if the enemy is moving. Her Protective Barrier is best used on choke points, and to suppress enemies. 
Orisa can use Halt! to pull enemies out of position, or coordinated with allies' abilities much like Zarya's ultimate Graviton Surge. Fortify has no downside; she can freely use it to increase her tanking power. Her Supercharger increases the damage output of her allies, but the device can be destroyed. While Orisa has strong front-facing defense, she is weak to flankers who can get behind her due to her low mobility. Considering that her barrier is an unmovable object, and that her weapon can't attack multiple foes at close range, she is vulnerable when surrounded or being attacked from other angles. As she is a fairly large target, and her combined health with her barrier is less than Reinhardt's, she is vulnerable to being taken down by a heavy damage dealer, or a sniper who can pick at her from extreme range.</p>

<h1> Winston </h1>
<h2> Role: Disruptor </h2>
<img src="Winston.png">
<p>Winston wields impressive inventions—a jump pack, electricity-blasting Tesla Cannon, portable shield projector and more—with literal gorilla strength. Winston is one of the game's most mobile Tanks, capable of crossing vast distances in a single leap to bring the fight to his enemies. His Tesla Cannon, combined with the agility provided by his Jump Pack, makes him a persistent menace that can easily disrupt any enemy team through constant harassment and the power of his Primal Rage. Much like Reinhardt, however, he is only capable of fighting at short range, and he is not nearly as consistently durable as the other Tanks. </p>


<h1>Support</h1>
<p> Support heroes can heal allies, enhance their team's abilities, and debuff enemies. They are poor duelists and perform best with their team around them. (exception of Ana and Zenyatta)</p>


<h1>Mercy</h1>
<h2>Role: Healer</h2>
<img src="Mercy.png">
<p>Mercy is capable of dealing damage, but is best played by following friendly heroes and healing and buffing them. Mercy is the most healing oriented of the Supports, capable of rapidly bringing her team back up to full Health and even using her Ultimate to bring them back from the dead. When not healing, she is able to boost a single ally's damage, allowing them to blast apart foes and tear through barriers. She is easily the most team dependent of the Supports: her personal damage is weak, and the powerful effect of her Ultimate makes her a prime target for the enemy team, forcing her to rely on her team for protection. </p>


<h1>Lucio</h1>
<h2>Role: Healer</h2>
<img src="Lucio.png">
<p>On the battlefield, Lúcio’s cutting-edge Sonic Amplifier buffets enemies with projectiles and knocks foes back with blasts of sound. His songs can both heal his team or boost their movement speed, and he can switch between tracks on the fly. On the battlefield, Lúcio’s cutting-edge Sonic Amplifier buffets enemies with projectiles and knocks foes back with blasts of sound. His songs can both heal his team or boost their movement speed, and he can switch between tracks on the fly.</p>


<h1>Ana</h1>
<h2>Role: Healer</h2>
<img src="Ana.png">
<p>Ana's versatile arsenal allows her to affect heroes all over the battlefield. Her Biotic Rifle rounds and Biotic Grenades heal allies and damage or impair enemies; her sidearm tranquilizes key targets, and Nano Boost gives one of her comrades a considerable increase in power. Ana is a mid to long-range Support sniper, capable of healing at any range while also maintaining a fair level of damage output. Her Biotic Grenade lets her amplify healing effects from not only her own healing darts but also from other Supports and environmental healing, such as Payloads and Health packs. She has a sidearm which will fire a Sleep Dart, which can render the enemy who's hit with it temporary useless unless someone wakes them up. 
Nano Boost is a supportive ultimate that is used to provide strong buffs to an ally, allowing them to deal more damage while taking less damage from the enemy. She can also be an anti-healer as her Biotic Grenade will prevent enemies hit by the blast from getting healed in any way, making her an outstanding support. Ana lacks all source of mobility and only has her sidearm to protect herself, making it easy for her to be outflanked by the flankers as well as other mobile heroes. If played really well, she can be one of the most powerful supports in the game</p>


<h1>Symmetra</h1>
<h2>Role: Defense/Support</h2>
<img src="Symmetra.png">
<p>Symmetra utilizes her light-bending Photon Projector to dispatch adversaries, shield her associates, construct teleportation pads and deploy particle-blasting Sentry Turrets. Symmetra is a unique Support hero who keeps her allies alive through unconventional means. She can deter enemies from traveling through chokepoints with her Sentry Turrets, protect allies while pushing chokepoints with her Photon Barrier, and can dramatically shorten the distance between the respawn room and the frontline with her Teleporter, or give her team a great health advantage with Shield Generator. Despite appearances, she is also one of the most damaging of the Support heroes, with a weapon that can deal devastating damage at both short and long range. 
Despite this, her complete inability to heal her allies, along with her relative fragility, makes it challenging for her to serve as the only Support on a team.</p>


<h1>Zenyatta</h1>
<h2>Role: Healer/Enforcer</h2>
<img src="Zenyatta.png">
<p>Zenyatta calls upon orbs of harmony and discord to heal his teammates and weaken his opponents, all while pursuing a transcendent state of immunity to damage. Zenyatta is a potent offense-focused Support. He stands out from the other supports due to his incredible killing power: his Orb of Destruction and Orb of Discord can let him shred through even the sturdiest of Tanks with well aimed shots. While not as powerful a healer as Mercy, his Orb of Harmony and Transcendence abilities are more than enough to let him keep a team alive when used smartly. All of this power is counterbalanced by a severe lack of mobility. Unless Zenyatta is using his ultimate, he moves at a relatively slow pace, and has no abilities to speed him up. 
This makes him vulnerable to agile flankers or large amounts of incoming fire.</p>
